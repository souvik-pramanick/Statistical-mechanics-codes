#Maxwell Boltzmann distribution problem
#Question:
	#A system consists of two particles each of which can be in any one single particle levels of respective energies 0 and Îµ. The system is in contact with a heat reservoir at temperature T. The particles follow MB-Statistics. Find 
	#(i)Partition function(Z), 
	#(ii)Average energy(<E>),
	#(iii)Relative R.M.S.fluctuation in E              #(iv)Specific heat capacity at constant volume
